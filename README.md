# azerothcore-automated

These scripts are designed to simplify the setup process of AzerothCore. However, it is advised not to use them in a production environment at this time, as they are still being developed.

The scripts in this repository have only been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using the minimized installation variant.
